*** GAME OBJECTIVE ***
- Round amount optional (3 - 10)
- Full air tank (🔴 at 25), Divers on submarine
- Bring treasures back (getting back to the sub on time with treasures)

*** TURN PROGRESSION ***
- STEP 1: Reduce
+ 🔴 moves towards 0 by Chips # you carry
+ If running out (0 or <0), become the last turn

- STEP 2: Turn back or not?
+ Turn-back-able when not having chips or having
+ Can decide when coming towards but not backwards (skip this step if backwards)
+ Roll dice when having TYPO ==> Forwards

- STEP 3: Roll dice & move
+ If not having chips, move # = roll #
+ If having chips, move # = roll # - chips # having
(If move # <= 0, no moving)
(If move # >= Undersea Chip, stop at the last one)

- STEP 4: Pick up or drop
+ ACTION 1: Do nothing
+ ACTION 2: Pick up Chip (NO FLIPPING), place blank chip
+ ACTION 3: Drop your chip if standing on the blank one

*** ROUND CONCLUSION ***
- Players made it to the sub reveals the Chip score
- Players didn't make it back before the oxygen running out, lost everything and get back to the sub
+ Stack their chips (from lowest to highest level) next to the last chip in the line of Undersea chips
+ Max 3 chips/place, but treated as 1 chip when calculating air consumption and movement
- Remove blank chips, slide together
- Last player return to the Sub takes the first turn of the next round

*** GAME CONCLUSION ***
- Total points
- If having tie, players with the most high-lvl Chips win.
- If being unable to break the tie, end the game.
